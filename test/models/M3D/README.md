Model 3D Samples
================

 aliveai_character.m3d - from Minetest aliveai mod (textures, animations, original 47k, m3d 2.5k)
 cube.m3d - smallest possible example, 119 bytes only
 cube_normals.m3d - cube with normal vectors, 159 bytes
 cube_usemtl.m3d - converted from Assimp sample OBJ by the same name, cube with materials
 cube_with_vertexcolors.m3d - converted from Assimp sample OBJ by the same name, cube with vertex colors
 cube_with_vertexcolors.a3d - same, but saved in ASCII variant with Windows line endings (\r\n)
 mobs_dwarves_character.m3d - from Minetest mobs_dwarves mod (with Assimp artifacts converted perfectly too...)
 suzanne.m3d - exported from Blender (monkey face, with normals and texture UVs and materials)
 WusonBlitz0.m3d - from Assimp sample by the same name (was 87k, triangle mesh) with int8 coordinates, minor quality degradation
 WusonBlitz1.m3d - same, but uses int16 coordinates (no noticable difference to the original, but just 35k)
 WusonBlitz2.m3d - same, but with 32 bit floating point numbers (same precision as the original, half the file size, 42k)
